                <h1>KYLO'S LIGHTSABER</h1>
                <p>We've seen several lightsaber designs over the year but Kylo Ren's is one
                of the most striking.
                An ancient design with modern components may look the part but in actuality it
                tells us more about it's weilder than he would like us to know</p>
                <p>The quillions which adds to it;s aura are actually vital to enable the saber
                to contain the power of the weapon. The cracked kyber crystal at the heart
                of the weapon needs the quillions to vent it's
                excess power
                The ragged unstable appearance is another result of second grade parts and also reflects
                the unstable personality of Kylo Ren.</p>
                <p>Kylo was being trained by his uncle Luke Skywalker before Supreme Leader Snoke was able
                to tempt his towards the Dark Side and he was unable to finish his Jedi training, the
                culmination of which would be assembling his own lightsaber
                Undeterred by this Kylo constructed his own saber and unfortunately for many people has not
                been afraid to use it.</p>
