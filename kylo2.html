            <h1>KYLO'S TALE</h1>
            
                <p>Who is Kylo Ren?</p>
                <p>Before he adopted the name Kylo, Ben Solo was the child or Princess Leia Organa 
                    and Han Solo. His uncle is Luke Skywalker who led a Jedi Academey to which young 
                    Ben attended. As well as war heroes for parents his grandfather was none other 
                    than Darth Vader. This is who he looked up to and hoped to emulate, and 
                    Supreme Leader Snoke capitalised on this, influencing young Solo astray.
                    Snoke believes Ren to be an ideal embodiment of the Force, a focal point of both
                    the Dark and the Light side. 
                </p>
                <p>Under the influence of Snoke, Ben betrays and destroys his Jedi peers, putting a stop
                    to Luke Skywalker's plans to restore the Jedi Order. Ben becomes Kylo Ren, building his 
                    own lightsaber and helps lead the First Order's attempts to destroy the Resistance and find
                    Skywalker who has fled to an unknown location
                </p>
                <p>With Skywalker blood flowing through him it is unsurprising to see Kylo possessing a 
                    powerful connection to the Force which he is able to maninpulate and read in various 
                    ways.
                </p>
                <p id = "last">On his quest to the Dark Side Kylo seeks to demonstrate Ben is no more as he does 
                    the unthinkable and kills his father Han Solo during the attack on Starkiller Base.
                    Beaten by the mysterious Rey, Supreme Leader Snoke knows he is ready to recieve
                    his final training.</p>
